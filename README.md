# SDG-7-interlinkages-on-a-local-level
This study examines how interlinkages between SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and other SDGs manifest at the city level. Using over 10,000 indicators from 120 Voluntary Local Reviews, a novel methodology was developed combining semantic embeddings, probabilistic clustering, large language models, progress scoring, and causal discovery.
